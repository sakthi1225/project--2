# project--2
##ABSTRACT
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a customer sales dataset to extract meaningful insights about customer behavior, purchasing patterns, and churn probability. It also includes preprocessing, feature encoding, and model building to predict customer churn. The ultimate aim is to help businesses make data-driven decisions to improve customer engagement, optimize sales strategies, and reduce churn rates.
##INTRODUCTION
Understanding customer behavior is essential for any successful business. This project explores a sales and customer behavior dataset using Python and various data analysis libraries to reveal valuable insights. By analyzing customer transactions, purchase frequencies, average order values, and churn probabilities, we aim to identify patterns that influence sales performance and customer loyalty.
##PROBLEM STATEMENT
In a competitive market, retaining customers is just as important as acquiring new ones. The dataset offers detailed insights into sales and customer interactions, helping businesses:
1. Track purchasing behavior and sales patterns
2. Detect potential churn early
3. Implement effective retention strategies
4. Enhance decision-making based on data analysis
5. ##PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS
